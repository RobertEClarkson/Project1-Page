            <h3>Significance</h3>
            Castlevania is very similar to metroid in its gameplay so it was no wonder why I got so sucked into this franchise. Even so, <i>&ldquo;What 
            makes it any different from Metroid?&rdquo;</i> you may ask. Well, sometimes all that needs to be different is the aesthetic for a series 
            to completely pull you in. Metroid and Castlevania are such an inspiration to countless other games that because of these two franchises,
            the genre is referred to as, &ldquo;<b>MetroidVania</b>&rdquo;.
          </p>

            Castlevania is a series about venturing into Dracula&rsquo;s domain and sending him back to the depths of hell. You travel through dark 
            forests full of beasts, haunted manors teeming with ghouls, and the castle of Count Dracula, otherwise known as <i>Castlevania</i>. The 
            artworks and designs of characters and creatures are just so striking. The music of the series has also always been a highlight. No 
            matter the game, there is always a theme that will get stuck in my head. It is such a shame that the series may never see a new release, 
            however, due to legal stuff, but I always go back to play through my favorites again every now and then.

          <h3>Order of Ecclesia</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>
            <img src="Images/Shanoa.jpg" alt="Artwork from Order of Ecclesia" width="273" height="512" class="flowRight"/> 
            The game that introduced me to the Castlevania series was Order of Ecclesia on the Nintendo DS. Compared to Metroid, you have access to so many more
            weapons and abilities, and exploration is a bit more action-oriented. The combat was much faster and more difficult, and bosses were more of a threat.
            I didn&rsquo;t think I would find another series like Metroid, so I was immediately invested. 
          </p>
          <h4>Gameplay</h4>
          <p>
            The game is separated into levels that you
            can access on the world map rather than having each and every one of them connect to another. Each level is layed out similarly to metroid 
            where you move in a 2D space and explore many rooms to find powerups and items to progress. Shanoa has the ability 
            to absorb the powers of the demons you defeat on your journey. After absorbing many of the abilities, she has access to a vast array of 
            different weapons, magic, and even transformations that turn her into different creatures. As you complete each level, you unlock more areas 
            to explore until you reach Dracula&rsquo;s castle. 
          </p>
          <h4>Plot</h4>
          <p>
            Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia takes place after Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, sometime in the 1800s, right after the era of 
            Richter Belmont. Since the Belmont Clan had vanished by that time, several organizations are created in order to research countermeasures 
            against Dracula and his eventual return. Among these organizations, the most promising was the Order of Ecclesia, who created a triad of 
            magical glyphs based on Dracula's power, named "Dominus." Shanoa is a member chosen by the order's leader, Barlowe, as the human vessel for 
            Dominus. As the ritual begins, the Dominus glyphs (Anger, Hatred, Agony) are stolen by Shanoa's colleague Albus, and Shanoa loses her memories 
            and emotions. She goes to retrieve them, unaware of his true intentions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="Images/ShanoaFire.jpg" alt="Artwork from Order of Ecclesia" width="512" height="274" class="flowLeft"/> 
            In her pursuit, Shanoa arrives in the deserted Wygol Village and finds out that Albus kidnapped its inhabitants, brought them to different hidden 
            locations, and imprisoned them. As Shanoa rescues them throughout the game, she learns that Albus captured them to perform some kind of experiment 
            on them which involved taking samples of their blood. On two occasions, Shanoa tracks down Albus, who willingly gives her two of the Dominus glyphs. 
            When she finds him to be possessed by the power of the third glyph, she is forced to fight him. After killing Albus, his mind and soul are absorbed 
            by Shanoa together with the last Dominus glyph. Albus explains that his true intentions were to find a way to defeat Dracula without Shanoa using 
            Dominus, as he knew that it would kill her if she used it. Her lost memories and emotions were actually taken by Dominus, and not Albus, as Barlowe 
            had told Shanoa. He also reveals that the reason he experimented on the villagers was because they were the last known descendants of the Belmont 
            Clan, and he believed their blood would have the power to help him control Dominus without it consuming him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confronting Barlowe after learning the truth, Shanoa learns that his true objective is to bring Dracula back to life, using Shanoa as a sacrifice. 
            After Barlowe is defeated in a fight, he offers his own life to revive Dracula, and Dracula's castle appears. Eventually confronting Dracula, Shanoa 
            successfully defeats him using Dominus, seemingly at the cost of her own life. However, Albus appears and reveals that only a single soul has to be 
            offered. He sacrifices his own soul in Shanoa's place, but not before he restores her memories and emotions and asks her to smile for him. The castle 
            crumbles, and Shanoa escapes.
