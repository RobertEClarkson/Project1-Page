                <h3>My Favorite Games</h3>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;ve always wanted to create a list to keep track of my favorite game series that I have played throughout my life as a sort of
                    archive to look back on. Many years from now, or just when I&rsquo;m feeling nostalgic, I can come back to it and reminisce. 
                    The selection of game series for that list would be those that have left an especially lasting impact and shaped my tastes in genres.
                    In other words, my &ldquo;<b>Pillars&nbsp;of&nbsp;Gaming</b>&rdquo; as I refer to them in my head (sounds kind of corny reading this back 
                    but whatever, you get the idea). 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Now that I&rsquo;m learning HTML, I thought this was the <i>perfect</i> opportunity to work on something 
                    that could create such a list, or more specifically, create an entire site containing custom pages for each and every game! As I become more 
                    skilled at web design, I will continue to add to this site and make it more dynamic. I look forward to seeing how far I can take it!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below you will find a list that contains a description of each one of my &ldquo;Pillar&rdquo; 
                    series with the link to a page dedicated to them located within the titles themselves. I decided to organize them by chronological 
                    order of when I played them rather than release or alphabetical order.

                        Sci-fi Action-Adventure series that follows Inter-Galactic bounty hunter Samus Aran, whose mission is
                        to eradicate the titular hostile parasitic organisms known as Metroids and the Space Pirates who aim to harness

                        The series takes a lot of inspiration from the Ridley Scott film <i>Alien</i> and H.R. Giger's art with one of the
                        main villains even being named &ldquo;Ridley&rdquo;. Big focus on exploration.

                        Dark Fantasy Action Role-Playing Game(RPG) where a nameless undying warrior(the player) wakes up in a perilous, decaying world and sets out
                        to discover the fate of undead humans like themselves. Most of the story of this series is told through scattered texts and environmental
                        details. Upon death, the player drops all of their &ldquo;souls&rdquo; which is the in-game currency used to level up or purchase items.
                        If the player fails to retrieve their souls before dying again, all of it is lost. This fact leads players to be more mindful of their 
                        surroundings, as the punishment for failure is steep.
