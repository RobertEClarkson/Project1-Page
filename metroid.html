            <h3>Significance</h3>
            Metroid was the first game series I ever played that stuck with me after playing it. The games I had played before were the type 
            you&rsquo;d play for an hour before you move on to something else. Metroid, however, I couldn&rsquo;t put down. Unlocking new
            power ups and exploring new and different areas of the planet were so engaging to me. Samus as a character was also so cool to 
            me as a kid. Her armor was unlike anything I had seen in the other games I played; her entire arm was a cannon and she had a visor 
            that completely covered her face. She would never speak, but you knew she wasn&rsquo;t someone you should mess with by the way she 
            unflinchingly blasts through any hostile organism that crosses her path.

          <h3>Zero Mission</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>
            <img src="Images/MetroidZeroMission.png" alt="Comparison between the original Metroid and remake" width="484" height="206" class="flowLeft"/>
            The exact game that I first played from this series was called Metroid: Zero Mission. It is a remake of the original Metroid game
            from 1986 on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was made for the Gameboy Advance in 2004 and not only faithfully
            translated the original to&mdash;at the time&mdash;modern graphical standards, but also added completely new content and story (It 
            even had the NES version included on the cartridge!). The original Metroid just had you start the game with no hints as to what to 
            do, nor did it have a map that you could reference to figure out where you were going. Even for the time, it was pretty difficult 
            to play the game all the way to the end due to those factors. So, this remake was perfect for a kid like me who would have no idea 
            where to even begin with the original. 
          </p>
          <h4>Gameplay</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="Images/ZMGameplay.gif" alt="Gameplay from Metroid Zero Mission" width="350" height="200" class="flowRight"/>
            At the beginning of the game, you land on the planet Zebes and after a quick cutscene, you are immediately left to find your way around.
            The player is free to explore but many areas are inaccessible without certain power ups or are guarded by a boss enemy. More experienced
            players can attempt something called a &ldquo;Sequence Break&rdquo; where they use their skills and knowledge of the game to reach places
            that usually wouldn&rsquo;t be accessible. This is a big reason why these games are so replayable. Your main weapon
            is the arm cannon, which can be fired infinitely and can be aimed in forwards and diagonally up and down. In order to open doors, you have 
            to shoot them with the appropriate weapon: Blue doors can be opened with all weapons, red doors with missiles, and more as the game 
            progresses. In order to save your progress, you have to find specific save rooms rather than the game automatically doing it for you.
            This leads the player to either try to take risks and explore further in hopes of finding another save room or be more careful knowing
            that dying before reaching a save room will lead to loss of progress.
          </p>
          <h4>Plot</h4>
          <p>
            As this is a remake of an NES game, the story is not too complicated. Samus Aran is a bounty hunter tasked with exterminating all
            organisms known as Metroids on the planet Zebes. Metroids are parasites that feed on any and all living organisms and drain them 
            of their life energy. On top of dealing with them, she must also take on the space pirates and an organism called &ldquo;Mother Brain&rdquo;
            which controls the facility holding the space pirate collection of metroids. After Samus defeats Mother Brain and eliminates all of
            the metroids, she escapes the self-destructing facility and takes off in her space ship to leave the planet. This is where the original
            game ends; however, in Zero Mission, an extra story scenario is added here. 
          </p>

            <img src="Images/ZMEscape.gif" alt="Zero suit Samus evades a space pirate" width="350" height="200" class="flowLeft"/>
            After Samus successfully escapes planet Zebes, she removes her power suit since the mission has been completed. Suddenly,
            space pirate ships pursue her and manage to shoot down her ship and she crash lands back down on the surface of the planet.
            Now, she is left almost defenseless, wielding only a stun gun. Without her power suit or any of the upgrades she had found
            throughout the game, she now has to infiltrate the space pirate mothership to try and take one of their escape shuttles.
            This section is more stealth-focused, since Samus&rsquo; stun gun cannot harm enemies, the player has to approach encounters
            more carefully. She has to stay out of sight of surveillance lasers, tripwires, and patrolling space pirates all while making her way 
            throughout the ship. At one point she finds her way back out of the ship and into an ancient temple full of artifacts of the 
            Chozo, the alien race that created the technology for her power suit. Here she undertakes a trial to see if she is still worthy 
            to wield the power suit and prevails. With her powers restored, and new and enhanced abilities, she makes quick work of the 
            remaining space pirates and once again escapes the planet Zebes (for real this time).
